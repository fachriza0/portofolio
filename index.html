            Hi, my name's Fachriza Habibi. Graduated at Universitas Muhammadiyah Sumatera Utara in 2024, majoring in Information Technology. On your left, it's me. I love listening to music, currently listening to Deftones, Sleep Token. I also like Lil Tecca in Rap genre. I also like to play games, but i was crazy when i was younger. These days, i know my priorities, so i can't play games too much. I also have some passion in music, i really want to make an album, filled with music i create myself inspired by artists i love.

I wanted to do it myself but i don't have the tools needed to make one, so i halt it until who knows when.</p>

              On the left, you can see me playing alone. Yes, but it's not in my room, it is my friend's. The guitar, the computer, all of it is my friend's. Having my own recording room is a dream for now, I'll get there when i get there. Oh, if you want to see us on Youtube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lowkii18" target="_blank">click on this link</a>.
